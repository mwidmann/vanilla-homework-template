## Usage

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm serve` to start the development server. This will also set up tailwindcss for watching the files.

Run `npm test` for running both the unit (`npm test:unit`) and e2e (`npm test:e2e`) tests. The e2e tests will also start the webserver and tailwind build process.
